# HttpRequestAssignment

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.1 and uses Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Assignment: HTTP Request Handling

### Task

Build an Angular service to fetch data from a REST API and display it in a component.

### Requirements

- **Create an Angular service** to handle HTTP requests using `HttpClient`.
- **Fetch data** from a mock REST API endpoint.
- **Display the fetched data** in a component.
- **Implement error handling** for failed HTTP requests.

### Evaluation Criteria

- Proper implementation of the Angular service for HTTP requests.
- Correct handling of asynchronous data retrieval.
- Effective error handling for HTTP request failures.
- Proper display of fetched data in the component template.

### Guidelines

- Focus on writing clean, well-organized code.
- Prefer avoiding pre-defined functions/libraries.
- Pay attention to the design and layout of the user interface.
- Implement sorting functionality using any method you like.
- Ensure the application is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Feel free to use any additional libraries or frameworks if necessary.

### Styling with Tailwind CSS

- This project uses Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.
- Ensure that Tailwind CSS classes are used to achieve a clean and responsive design.
- Refer to the [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) for class utilities and customization.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
